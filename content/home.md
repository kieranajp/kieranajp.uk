# About Me

Hey! I'm yet another Person Who Makes Things On The Internet.

I'm a British developer living and working in Berlin, Germany. I'm currently working for [HelloFresh](https://www.hellofresh.com) as a Senior Developer; previously I've worked as as Lead Developer at a [tiny three-person agency in Canterbury](https://www.mpjdesign.ltd.uk) providing website builds and technical consultancy to businesses throughout the UK and Europe, and as a Business Analyst at Intel.

I also freelance from time to time - find out more about that in the [Work section](/work). I can provide web design and development services, technical consultancy, or mobile apps (preferably [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)). Recently I'm getting into photography too, but that's more of a hobby.

If you agree, disagree, enjoy, or have any comments about my work or the content of my site I encourage you to [get in touch with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kieranajp).
