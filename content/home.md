# About Me

Hey! I'm yet another Person Who Makes Things On The Internet.

I'm a British developer living and working in Berlin, Germany. I'm currently Director of Engineering at [HelloFresh](https://www.hellofresh.com); previously I've worked as Lead Developer at a [tiny agency in Canterbury, UK](https://www.mpjdesign.ltd.uk) providing website builds and technical consultancy to businesses throughout the UK and Europe, and as a Business Analyst at Intel.

I also freelance from time to time - find out more about that in the [Work section](/work). Recently I'm getting into [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kieranajp) too, but that's more of a hobby.

If you agree, disagree, enjoy, or have any comments about my work or the content of my site I encourage you to [get in touch with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kieranajp).
